> The student is inspired by the sound of Construction in Wuhan. “Different everyday” is the slogan of Wuhan. However, the price of rapid changing is to accept the mess. There are over 2 millions “immigrant workers” in Wuhan, who work over 8 hours everyday bearing the noisy working condition. This trigger my desire to visualize the feelings. It is highly interactive and reflecting time and space. Hopefully, it is a record of China during the periods of "under construction".
