### Media Technology UG2
Media Technology course aims at presenting a knowledge-based foundations to the digital media undergraduates. It covers:  
* Image, Video and Audio acquisition, processing and compression
* Fundamentals of Light and Sound
* Digital information storage and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
In the BCU module guide, three learning objectives should be fulfilled, which are:
* Demonstrate an understanding of the operating characteristic and applications of systems involving capture and processing of Image, audio and human-interaction.
* Explain the application of communication and networking in media processing and distribution systems including: how audio visual information is transmitted on the internet.
* Present original analysis of technologies and markets from wide ranging research.

This course is different from most of "design courses" for it requires students to write a logical essay rather than use the learned knowledge to create a work(Video, Audio, Website and so on). However, the report's topic is decided by students who should address a specific area related to video compression. 
### The Challenge
The students struggled not only because the essay should be written in English, but also the way to "create" their own essay. Usually, "art-based" students are trained think and create a work(artwork) subjectively. However, they are confused by presenting "objective" knowledge and are required to write an essay to address their own thinkings.   

I worked with the course leader Alan Dolhasz and as a teching assistant who speaks Chinese and know Chinese students more, I totally understand this problem. Trained as an Interaction Designer, I reminded how effective and efficient the "card sorting" method is when we designers try to learning new information under unfamiliar conditions.    

Usually, the [card sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-89cj71-Vfg) is conducted between two people (one interviewer and on interviewee). In my previous experience, I found the essential part of card sorting is by asking and speaking out the thinkings inside the brains. In my teaching activities (tutorial classes), I generated several questions based on the lecture contents and asked students to search answers after classes. The students are encouraged to ask their own questions and will receive additional credits when they proposed good questions.  


### From "Knowledge" to "Questions"
The courses include lectures, workshops and independent study. Usually the lectures is taught by the module leader and the content is almost fixed. As the teaching assistant, I used the workshops to guide the students to practice the learned knowledge (for example, shown the "Wagon Wheel Effect" by let them shoot a rotating wheel). However, I also help them formulate the questions based on their lectures. Students should use independent study as their own time to answer these questions and propose more valuable questions. 

Here is an example from "Week1: Foundations of Digital Camera" to show how we "tranfer" knowlege to questions 

*Lecture Covered* 

1. Visible Light Specturm
2. Additive(light) vs Subtractive(paint) 
3. Blackbody Radiation and Color temperature 
4. Digital image sensors 
5. CMOS vs CCD 
6. RAW format 
7. Aliasing 
8. Moire pattern 
9. Rolling Shutter 
10. Wagon Wheel Effect 
11. Partial Exposure

*Questions assigned to Students*   

1. What is light? 
2. What are the differences between RGB and CMYK? 
3. What does a color filter do? 
4. What are the different between Full Frame Camera and APS-C camera? 
5. What is bit depth?  
6. What are the differences between 8-bit and 16-bitWhat is crop factor? 
7. What is crop factor? 
8. Which one of CCDs and CMOS sensors is using "rolling shutter"? 
9. Why there will be a wagon wheel effect?
