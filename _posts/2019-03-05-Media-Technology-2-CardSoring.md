#### Media Technology UG2
Media Technology course aims at presenting a knowledge-based foundations to the digital media undergraduates. It covers:  
* Image, Video and Audio acquisition, processing and compression
* Fundamentals of Light and Sound
* Digital information storage and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
In the BCU module guide, three learning objectives should be fulfilled, which are:
* Demonstrate an understanding of the operating characteristic and applications of systems involving capture and processing of Image, audio and human-interaction.
* Explain the application of communication and networking in media processing and distribution systems including: how audio visual information is transmitted on the internet.
* Present original analysis of technologies and markets from wide ranging research.

This course is different from most of "design courses" for it requires students to write a logical essay rather than use the learned knowledge to create a work(Video, Audio, Website and so on). However, the report's topic is decided by students who should address a specific area related to video compression. 
#### The Challenge
The students struggled not only because the essay should be written in English, but also the way to "create" their own essay. Usually, "art-based" students are trained think and create a work(artwork) subjectively. However, they are confused by presenting "objective" knowledge and are required to write an essay to address their own thinkings.   

I worked with the course leader Alan Dolhasz and as a teching assistant who speaks Chinese and know Chinese students more, I totally understand the frustrations.   









Week 1
* shutter speed, ISO, aperture
* resolution
* focal length (50mm vs 150mm)
* brightness and contrast
* frames per second(fps)
* bit depth [Bit Depth: 8-bit Vs. 16-bit – Retouching Academy](https://retouchingacademy.com/qualities-of-digital-images-bit-depth/)
* image histograms
* HSL,HSV
* Shadow, Midtones, Highlights

Questions:
* Which aperture should you choose for achieving a "sharp" image?
* What are the mathematic equations behind the "historgram normalization" and "contrast increment"?
* How to "dignosing" an image? [History of Retouching: Photographers and Retouchers Synergy in the Analog Photography Era – Retouching Academy](https://retouchingacademy.com/history-of-retouching-photographers-and-retouchers-synergy-in-the-analog-photography-era/) 
* What are digital image?
* Why is compression important?
* What is resolution?

Week 2 
* Visible Light Specturm
* Additive(light) vs Subtractive(paint)
* Blackbody Radiation and Color temperature
* Digital image sensors
* CMOS vs CCD
* RAW format
* Aliasing
* Moire pattern
* Rolling Shutter
* Wagon Wheel Effect
* Partial Exposure

Questions:
* What is light?
* What does a color filter do?
* What are the different between Full Frame Camera and APS-C camera?
* What is crop factor?
* Why there will be a wagon wheel effect?


Exercise: Answer these questions, we will review them next week.
1. What are digital images?
2. Why is compression important?
3. What is resolution? 
4. What is bit depth? What are the differences between 8-bit and 16-bit
5. What are shadows, midtones, highlights?
6. What is frames per second(fps)? 
7. What is light?
8. What does a color filter do?
9. What are the different between Full Frame Camera and APS-C camera?
10.What is crop factor?
11.Why there will be a wagon wheel effect?
