### Stomach Medicine(胃必治)

##### Mojie Tang, Yuqing Zhou, Zimeng Huang

The project was inspired by a stomach ailment, which was tortured by stomach pain and understood the importance of the stomach. The stomach is not just a digestive container, it is also a friend who has been with us for a lifetime.

We use Processing to make a stomach shape, render a pink background, fill it with green particles that symbolize gastric juice, and press the middle button to add a yellow "drug"; press the mouse wheel to place the stomach drug for treatment The effect of pressing shift + left mouse button can be used to launch the bullet to stir the stomach juice; the right button can eliminate the gastric juice.

The audience finds a kind of fun in the interaction, which leads to an inspiration: whether we know our stomach and whether we can treat our stomach well.
