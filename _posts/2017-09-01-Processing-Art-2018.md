### Stomach Medicine(胃必治)

##### Mojie Tang, Yuqing Zhou, Zimeng Huang

The project was inspired by a stomach ailment, which was tortured by stomach pain and understood the importance of the stomach. The stomach is not just a digestive container, it is also a friend who has been with us for a lifetime.

We use Processing to make a stomach shape, render a pink background, fill it with green particles that symbolize gastric juice, and press the middle button to add a yellow "drug"; press the mouse wheel to place the stomach drug for treatment The effect of pressing shift + left mouse button can be used to launch the bullet to stir the stomach juice; the right button can eliminate the gastric juice.

The audience finds a kind of fun in the interaction, which leads to an inspiration: whether we know our stomach and whether we can treat our stomach well.

### Synesthesia Alphabet(通感症字母表)

##### Ruihan Yu, Ying Huang, Wenqian Hu, Yiming Wuhuang

What is the world of the people with synesthesia? Every word, every sentence, has a unique color, smell and sound. Words are like water, which are the basic element: in the sky, they are flowing clouds; on the earth, they are falling water. When they are arranged in a special way, they will shine like the rain and moisten the world in our hearts. When we look at the world with different eyes, those beautiful words will linger in our hearts.

### The Choice Before And Now(过去和现在的选择)

##### Zehuan Xu, Shiru Wang

Our project concept originally comes from Dali's painting named "The Persistence of Memory", which is related to the clock (time). We wanted to express the things in our life and they gradually took up the time of our lives. But this idea has caused us a lot of troubles - too many things to choose.

So we shortened the time to three years in high school and changed it to a questionnaire. When the audiences face each item, they can click on the color they think to represent the period.

We want to collect people's memories and thoughts about high school and make a work similar to data visualization. Now, think about the choices made at the beginning, are they really what we thought before?

### Corpulence(吃胖)

##### Jingtong Cheng, Qiuyu Yu, Qian He, Junyue Zhang

"Obesity" is linked to un-beauty and squatting. It is a common group of metabolic syndrome. The volume and amount of fat cells in the body increase abnormally, and the percentage of body fat to body weight is abnormally increased. When the body eats more calories than consumption, fat synthesis, and it is the material basis of obesity.

Usually, the girls think that "only food and love can not be disappointed, spring is too short, it is better to eat fat". So sweet or hot and crisp high-calorie food are added to their stomaches. A unit of calories can raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius at a standard atmospheric pressure. As an energy unit, it is almost same as heat. Calories come from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and these three things come from food.

The calorie value represents a possibility of a human-balanced relationship with food, but it is far more than warning of fat. The other side of the ease is often the hidden dangers; another possibility comes from the turn-away from donuts, the cheese-flavored chicken, and then: to enter the world of great inspiration for humanity.

## Hot As Dog(热成狗)

##### Ruzhe Cai, Duanying ZHang, Hehui Zhang, Fei Xie

The inspiration for our interactive design is the summer days of Wuhan. As global warming becomes more severe and glaciers melt, global warming has threatened our environment. In face of this problem, we are caught in thinking.

In this design, we use temperature sensors to interact with human body temperature changes. At lower temperatures, the puppies and cows are in a normal state, and the temperature of the sensor rises with the holding time while holding the sensor. At the same time, the dog and the cow begin to melt and deform, and the icons on the display will change from puppies and cows to hot dogs and milk. When the temperature falls back, the opposite changing process will be presented.

Akerlof said: In the face of global warming, we lack a story of motivational action. And our interaction wants to use the form of temperature visualization to call people to participate in it and act.

## Cellutopia(细胞社会)

##### Yinyin Yu, Wenwen Yang, Yiwen Liu

We believe that the living state of an ideal society is that people can fully realize their own ideas without affecting others. For example, you can decide to pursue an ideal job and decide your own life direction. However, this freedom is completely detached from the material basis and is actually difficult to achieve.

Real life is a combination of material and spiritual, and also a conflict between material and spiritual. Compared with an ideal freedom, reality presents a state of disorder and turbulence. This work is in opposition to pure spirit and uses material expression to reflect the spiritual oppression brought about by reality.

The protagonist of the work is the unit of matter that constitutes human beings - cells, each cell representing a person in the purely physical sense. The regular squares represent social rules.

The first part focuses on a person walking leisurely in an ideal society out of the limits. The second part reflects people's nervous reaction to life through its jitter. It reflects the spiritual state of real life through material expression, contrasts with the first part, highlights the conflict and integration of ideal and reality, revealing subtle irony.
