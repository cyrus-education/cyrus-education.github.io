### Stomach Medicine(胃必治)

##### Mojie Tang, Yuqing Zhou, Zimeng Huang

The project was inspired by a stomach ailment, which was tortured by stomach pain and understood the importance of the stomach. The stomach is not just a digestive container, it is also a friend who has been with us for a lifetime.

We use Processing to make a stomach shape, render a pink background, fill it with green particles that symbolize gastric juice, and press the middle button to add a yellow "drug"; press the mouse wheel to place the stomach drug for treatment The effect of pressing shift + left mouse button can be used to launch the bullet to stir the stomach juice; the right button can eliminate the gastric juice.

The audience finds a kind of fun in the interaction, which leads to an inspiration: whether we know our stomach and whether we can treat our stomach well.

### Synesthesia Alphabet(通感症字母表)

##### Ruihan Yu, Ying Huang, Wenqian Hu, Yiming Wuhuang

What is the world of the people with synesthesia? Every word, every sentence, has a unique color, smell and sound. Words are like water, which are the basic element: in the sky, they are flowing clouds; on the earth, they are falling water. When they are arranged in a special way, they will shine like the rain and moisten the world in our hearts. When we look at the world with different eyes, those beautiful words will linger in our hearts.

### The Choice Before And Now(过去和现在的选择)

##### Zehuan Xu, Shiru Wang

Our project concept originally comes from Dali's painting named "The Persistence of Memory", which is related to the clock (time). We wanted to express the things in our life and they gradually took up the time of our lives. But this idea has caused us a lot of troubles - too many things to choose.

So we shortened the time to three years in high school and changed it to a questionnaire. When the audiences face each item, they can click on the color they think to represent the period.

We want to collect people's memories and thoughts about high school and make a work similar to data visualization. Now, think about the choices made at the beginning, are they really what we thought before?
