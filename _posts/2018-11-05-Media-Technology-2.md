#### Role: Teaching Assistant
#### Course Leader: Alan Dolhasz

#### Background of this course
Media Technology course aims at presenting a knowledge-based foundations to the digital media undergraduates. It covers:  
* Image, Video and Audio acquisition, processing and compression
* Fundamentals of Light and Sound
* Digital information storage and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
In the BCU module guide, three learning objectives should be fulfilled, which are:
* Demonstrate an understanding of the operating characteristic and applications of systems involving capture and processing of Image, audio and human-interaction.
* Explain the application of communication and networking in media processing and distribution systems including: how audio visual information is transmitted on the internet.
* Present original analysis of technologies and markets from wide ranging research.
The assessments divide into two part: paper test and a technical report that need to address a specific research area related to video compression. 

Week 1
* shutter speed, ISO, aperture
* resolution
* focal length (50mm vs 150mm)
* brightness and contrast
* frames per second(fps)
* bit depth [Bit Depth: 8-bit Vs. 16-bit – Retouching Academy](https://retouchingacademy.com/qualities-of-digital-images-bit-depth/)
* image histograms
* HSL,HSV
* Shadow, Midtones, Highlights

Questions:
* Which aperture should you choose for achieving a "sharp" image?
* What are the mathematic equations behind the "historgram normalization" and "contrast increment"?
* How to "dignosing" an image? [History of Retouching: Photographers and Retouchers Synergy in the Analog Photography Era – Retouching Academy](https://retouchingacademy.com/history-of-retouching-photographers-and-retouchers-synergy-in-the-analog-photography-era/) 
* What are digital image?
* Why is compression important?
* What is resolution?

Week 2 
* Visible Light Specturm
* Additive(light) vs Subtractive(paint)
* Blackbody Radiation and Color temperature
* Digital image sensors
* CMOS vs CCD
* RAW format
* Aliasing
* Moire pattern
* Rolling Shutter
* Wagon Wheel Effect
* Partial Exposure

Questions:
* What is light?
* What does a color filter do?
* What are the different between Full Frame Camera and APS-C camera?
* What is crop factor?
* Why there will be a wagon wheel effect?
