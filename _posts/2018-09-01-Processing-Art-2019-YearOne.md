### Final Works

##### Greasy Chin, Tong Xirui
First of all, the theme of this work is clear, it is a very greasy uncle's greasy chin and there are many yellow and red acne on his chin.Because it is my own drawing, this greasy chin is not so disgusting, and actually it is a little cute, round nose and round chin, vivid. The user could click and drag the chin, and the chin can be deformed accordingly, and the chin can be dragged at will. This is a bit funny and interactive. Because my technique is not enough, the acne will fly out of the chin, so I made an air wall. The mouse can’t drag. I can only do this. Hahahaha. What do I want to say in this work? That is, we can't become too greasy. Otherwise, the chin will not be well maintained and it will be distorted.

##### Scary Nostril, Tu Qingying
I got the theme with the word "Scary", and naturally I thought that the visual style should be a bit scary. And at the beginning, nobody could see the specific photo inside the black background, and with the clicks the scary picture blows up, it can have a strong effect after the image is enlarged. Click on any key on the keyboard to restore.

##### Lazy Machine, Long Ziyue
My theme is lazy mechanics, so I drew a small rocket, slow and slow to show that it was lazy. In order to make the picture more vivid, I added a little interactive effect: when the mouse moves on the screen, there will be a small ball to follow. That's it………

##### Silly TNP, Zhao Tian
The theme is ... emm "Silly TNP(Taiwan National Party)"! When I got the theme, I am actually very desperate and confused... Later I thought of combining the TNP elements with the funny emoji. The interactive effect of the rotation is mainly to fully reflect the characteristics of "silly". When the mouse moves to different places, there will be different speeds just to make the content more interesting and interesting...

##### Shamate Meat, Wang Chenziwei
Theme: Shamate (meaning extremely out-of-fashion in China) Meat
Visual Style: I want to make it as Shamate as possbile, but it seems that it is a little cute than Shamate
Interaction effects: control the size of the eyes with the mouse movements

##### Sissy Spade, Ren Mengying
"Do not live in the framework of society. Femininity is not necessarily bad, masculine is not necessarily what you want to pursue. No matter male or female, there is no established framework for gender identity." My theme is "Sissy Spade". Because I want to reflect the sense of "sissy", the background is a colorful gradient. I want to break the static and add visual diversity. So the unhappy spade in the work are shaking with the background music, and various labels for the "sissy boy" rise from below.

This work is based on the general perception towards "sissy boy" in the society. To face of the group of "sissy spades" that is limited by the society, I hope that there will be less ridicule or fanaticism. A spade is a inverted heart, with my expectation of respecting the diversity of the society.

##### Retarded Melon, Sang Mengshen

##### Free Mr.Banana, Wu Xinyu
Because the general colors of the work make people want to dance (perhaps not) when the flashing Mr.Banana is accompanied by such colors, it makes people feel his freedom (well, it’s just a bullshit).

Interaction effect: Make you want to dance when you look at it.

##### Peaceful Me, He Wencheng
It is very calm, without any movements and sounds, always watching the sun in the sky until the night and it is dark, he is still looking to the sky, but unfortunately can not wait for a round of moon, it is thinking of why is there no moon? The sun is also very calm, alternating every day in a constant dimension, and in this way, an infinite loop.

##### Terrible Nut, Zhang Hanjun
Why choose the current visual style: Because it looks short and sudden, you can scare the timid person like me.  I used the "JUMP SCARED" that I liked in the American horror movies.

The interaction effect:  Move the mouse on the black screen, and you can harvest a cute and touching nut at a specific location.
