> In the course "Processing Art", I introduce an artist each week to inspire the students. In this week, We used the codes to represent the art style of Yayoi Kusama. She uses a lot of strong colors dots to draw, which has become her marks. Every week, I tried to combine basic knowledge of processing into the art theme. For example, "for loop" is taught in the week of Yayoi Kusama in order to draw tons of dots. After that, students should be innovative and create their own dots.
