> Highly passionated in design and education, I decided to combine the two into one practice: Since 2016, I joined the Digital Media Department at Wuhan Textile University to teach and research. I have also been teaching high school students at No.1 Middle School affiliated to Central China Normal University (Top 1 high school in Hubei area). My main interest is to teach students using programming tools to realize their creativities. This leads to my research questions: Will the computational thinking will boost the creativity of the students? Generally speaking, programming tools have become more and more important for digital media students in terms of creating works and realizing concpets. I'm curious about how to design effective teaching and learning strategies to boost the learning activities of programming tools.

> Before working as a teacher, I'm a User Experience designer in Daimler China, 58.com, Taobao.com(Alibaba China) and so on. I used to study Interaction Design (master) at University of Kansas and digital media art (bachelor) at Communication University of China.   

_**I'm actively applying an Ph.D. program in Digital Media Arts.**_
