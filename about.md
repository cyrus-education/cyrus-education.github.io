> Highly passionated in design and education, I decided to combine the two into one practice: Since 2016, I joined the Digital Media Department at Wuhan Textile University to teach and research. I have also been teaching high school students at No.1 Middle School affiliated to Central China Normal University (Top 1 high school in Hubei area). My main interest is to teach students using programming tools to realize their creativities. This leads to my research questions: Will the computational (or digital) thinking will boost the creativity of the students? Generally speaking, I'm curious about how to design effective teaching and learning strategies to boost the creativities of the students? My current tryout is to merge the design methods into the teaching and learning activities.       

> Before working as a tutor, I'm a User Experience designer for Daimler China, 58.com, Taobao.com(Alibaba China) and etc. I used to study Interaction Design (master) at University of Kansas and digital media art (bachelor) at Communication University of China.   

#### I'm actively applying an PhD program in Learning Science.
