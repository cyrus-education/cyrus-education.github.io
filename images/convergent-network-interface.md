Description
Today’s already distracted, fragmented digital communications user experience is about to face a network explosion unprecedented in size and complexity (i.e., an “Internet of Everything”). Question: In light of this massive network growth, how can the network interface be deliberately shaped to favor essential human factors and the interests of individuals over other the interests of network technology? We set out to discover how people mentally represent themselves and their own interests in relation to their use of network technology to meet their interests and needs. We suspect a dissonance, if not an outright disconnect in the quality of that user experience. We explored a human-centered OS plug-in concept that enables users to naturally configure their device-system UI in accordance with their own assessed perspective on the world, their interests, priorities and needs.
