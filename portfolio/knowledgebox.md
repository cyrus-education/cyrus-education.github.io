> Knowledge Box is a self-driven project into an area of education and technology. During the six month thesis process, I worked to use mixed methods to explore the data fully. For the subject of development, I decided to explore how people construct knowledge and connect using mobile technologies. Knowledge box provides an opportunity that connects people with people through sharing and receiving knowledge. It encourage an one-to-one learning experience. Three levels of experience is considered during the designing: mobile interfaces, phone service, physical platforms.  A reputation system is considered to build in order to provide accurate knowledge.
