> We investigated current situation by researching on on-campus signage, KU parking website, KU parking map, KU navigation app, Google map app. We define problems of the existing system and found there is no consistent service across campus. Since there isn’t consistent design across any of the campus buildings, it becomes difficult for people to easily form the mental models that aid in wayfinding – particularly those unfamiliar with the environment. In this project, we try to design a single, cohesive, usable, wayfinding tool that integrates with their daily lives and anticipates their daily needs.
