> Obesity is a challenge that we face in our society. An increasing trend of diagnosed obesity and over weight members of our population is alarming. There have been countless attempts to sell products, diets, or initiatives, yet the upward trend continues. How can design positively impact the health of our society? More specifically, how can a system of designed touch-points help motivate people to be more physically active and sustain that activity over time? In this project, “micro-ops” was considered to be designed in order to solve this problem. This mobile application encourages people to use fragmented time to do micro exercises. “Self-determination motivation” was the key consideration in the design process. This project is sponsored by Cerner Cooperation User experience design team.
